# Quantum Task : Deutsch Algorithm

## Introduction 🌌

quantum algorithms, i.e. algorithms harnessing the four postulates of quantum mechanics. We begin with a very simple quantum algorithm due to David Deutsch. 
Deutsch’s algorithm serves as an excellent proof of concept that, in certain settings, quantum computers are
strictly more powerful than classical ones. 
The problem which Deutsch’s algorithm tackles is stated in terms of binary functions f : {0, 1} 7→ {0, 1}.

The problem Deutsch’s algorithm tackles can now be stated as follows. Given a block box Uf implementing
some unknown function, determine whether the function is “constant” or “balanced”. Here,
constant means f always outputs the same bit, i.e. f(0) = f(1), and balanced means f outputs different bits
on different inputs, i.e. f(0) /= f(1).

## Task 📝

In this task, embark on a hands-on Qiskit journey, where you'll delve into implementing the four oracles in the Deutsch algorithm. You'll then engage in the challenge of identifying the specific state of the oracle that was chosen randomly by your code based on the measurement of your circuit.

- Constant one
- Constant Zero
- Balnced One
- Balnced Zero
